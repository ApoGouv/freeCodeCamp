          </h2>
          <p>
            As one of the most influential intellectuals of the twentieth
            century, Albert Camus was a spokesman for a generation scarred by
            two world wars. His writings addressed the issues of the isolation
            of man in the modern world, the difficulty of defining evil and
            death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon after Camus was born (7 November 1913), his father was killed
            in the First Battle of the Marne. His mother supported the family
            while working as a charwoman in a working-class district of Algiers.
            Camus, his brother (Lucien), mother, maternal grandmother and a
            paralyzed uncle all lived in a small, two-room apartment. Camus'
            first two collections of essays,
            <strong>L'Envers et l'endroit</strong> (1937) and
            <strong>Noces</strong> (1938) described the setting of his
            childhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1918 Camus entered primary school, where he encountered one of
            the key influences on his life, the teacher, Louis Germain who
            helped him win a scholarship to the Algiers lyc√©e (high school) in
            1923. In 1930, the first of his severe attacks of tuberculosis
            forced him to leave his unhealthy apartment and live on his own
            while studying philosophy at the University of Algiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            There, Camus met another one of the formative influences in his
            life, Jean Grenier, who helped him develop his literary and
            philosophical ideas. In 1936, Camus obtained a dipl√¥me d'√©tudes
            sup√©rieures for his thesis on the relationship between Greek and
            Christian thought in the writings of Plotinus and St. Augustine.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the 1930s, Camus became a prominent figure among the young
            left-wing intellectuals of Algiers. For a very short period of time,
            he was a member of the Algerian Communist Party, and he worked for
            the Th√©√¢tre du Travail (Workers' Theatre), which aimed to bring
            plays to working-class audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the outbreak of World War II, Camus was serving his
            apprenticeship as a journalist with the
            <strong>Alger-R√©publicain</strong> where he wrote an important
            series of articles analyzing the deplorable conditions among the
            Muslims of the Kabylie region. During the war--deemed unfit for
            service in the French army--Camus worked with the resistance as
            editor of the daily newssheet, <strong>Combat</strong>, which proved
            an apt vehicle for his left-wing views. Disillusionment with postwar
            politics led him to quit <strong>Combat</strong> in 1947.
          </p>
          <p>
            By then, Camus had become a leading literary figure.
            <strong>L'√âtranger</strong> (1942) won him fame and critical acclaim
            for his portraiture of modern "alienation." In that same year, he
            also published the influential, philosophical reflection "Le Mythe
            de Sisyphe," which presented a modern sense of the "absurd." Camus'
            second novel, <strong>La Peste</strong> (1947), was, on one hand, an
            account of the fight against the Plague and, on the other hand, a
            story of the struggle to define humanity. Other novels followed,
            <strong>L'Homme r√©volt√©</strong> (1951),
            <strong>La Chute</strong> (1956), and a collection of short stories,
            <strong>L'Exil et le royaume</strong>
            (1957).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1957, at the age of only forty-four, Camus received the Nobel
            Prize for Literature. Less than three years later he died in an
            automobile accident.
